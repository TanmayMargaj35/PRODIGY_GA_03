🎨 Task 03 – Markov Chain Text Generation
Internship Project – Prodigy Infotech

📌 Overview  
This project is part of my internship at Prodigy Infotech under the domain of Generative AI.  
In this task, I explored how to generate text using a simple Markov Chain algorithm. The system learns word transition patterns from a given dataset (`alice_in_wonderland.txt`) and produces new, human-like sentences in a book-style format.

🎯 Objectives  
- Understand and implement a basic Markov Chain model for text generation  
- Use a structured `.txt` dataset as training input  
- Generate creative and coherent text in paragraph format  
- Gain practical exposure to probabilistic models and text formatting in Python  

🧠 Model Used  
Markov Chain (n-gram model)  
A probabilistic model that predicts the next word based on the previous one or more words (bi-grams or tri-grams), capturing local word dependencies.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Regular Expressions (`re`)  
- Text Formatting (`textwrap`)  
- File I/O (Google Drive file integration)

🚀 How It Works  
- Mount Google Drive and load `alice_in_wonderland.txt`  
- Split text into n-grams to build a Markov transition dictionary  
- Randomly walk through the chain to generate new text  
- Format the output with paragraph-style indentation and line wrapping  

📘 Sample Output  
```
    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank,
    and of having nothing to do. She thought of climbing a tree and jumping off
    like she had done before. Suddenly, a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close
    by her...

    “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!” said the rabbit. Without hesitation,
    Alice followed it across the field and into a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
```

✅ Status  
✔️ Task Completed – Submitted as part of Task 03 for my internship at Prodigy Infotech.

📚 Learning Outcomes  
- Learned how to implement a basic text generator using a Markov Chain  
- Understood how word dependencies are modeled probabilistically  
- Improved formatting skills for generating clean, readable AI text output
